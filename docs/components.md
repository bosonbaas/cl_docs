# Components

Components are the building blocks of Amplify Classroom's activities, and are the pieces tied together and controlled with CL. Components connect to each other by their **sinks** and **sources**. The **sinks** of a component are the values which define its appearance and behavior, and the **sources** of a component are variables which contain the state of the component.

This resource is intended to be a quick reference for the data types and purpose of each source and sink. For a more interactive and official documentation, see [Amplify's Documentation](https://classroom.amplify.com/computation-layer/documentation#components).
