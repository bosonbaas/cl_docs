# About This Project

With a background in software engineering, when I first started working with the **Desmos Computation Layer (CL)**, I found myself often longing for a website that provides the bare-bones syntax rules and documentation of Desmos CL. While I understand that for the majority of Desmos CL users the existing resources may be more than enough, maybe there are some others like me out there who would appreciate this resource.
