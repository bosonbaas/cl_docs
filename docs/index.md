# The Unofficial Desmos CL Reference

This site is an unofficial reference for the Desmos CL syntax, intended to be up-to-date on newly introduced syntax. If you find this useful, fantastic! If there's anything you'd like to see added/changed about the current layout, please drop a request on the [GitHub](https://github.com/bosonbaas/cl_docs) repository, or even open up a pull request!

What you'll find here:

- Reference material that clarifies how CL expressions and state work.
- Tips, patterns, and troubleshooting notes from my own (and other contributors) experience working with CL.

This is intended as a reference for those already familiar with Desmos CL. If you're just starting, I'd encourage you to take a look at the official Desmos CL documentation [here](https://classroom.amplify.com/computation-layer/documentation)

## Contributing

If you've looked around the website, you may notice that there are a _lot_ of things missing! For example, what about those one-off functions like `parseOrderedPair`? And half of the components don't have a comprehensive list of types, what's up with that??

Thus, contributions are welcomed and _needed_! If you're comfortable with GitHub, then head over to the [Github](https://github.com/bosonbaas/cl_docs) page and open up an issue, or if you're really ambitious make a pull request! If you're not super comfortable with that, but still want to help fill in the documentation, feel free email me at [unofficialcldocs@gmail.com](mailto:unofficialcldocs@gmail.com)!

Additionally, if you have neat examples or hacks that you've developed and you think others would find helpful, please send them on in, and we can make them a resource for the rest of the community.
